## Problem

Transportation in Greencastle, especially for students at DePauw University, poses significant challenges. Public transit is scarce and operates on a limited schedule, leaving students without reliable options when they need them most. Many are forced to depend on friends, faculty, or other informal arrangements, creating barriers to everyday necessities and adding financial strain when accessing academic, social, or career opportunities out of town. For a vibrant campus like DePauw, transportation should be simple, stress-free, and accessible to all students, regardless of their circumstances.
